    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting statistical model1. It was originally introduced in geophysics and later by Robert Tibshirani1. It can be extended to other statistical models such as generalized linear models, proportional hazards models, and M-estimators1.\n",
    "The primary goal of LASSO regression is to find a balance between model simplicity and accuracy. It achieves this by adding a penalty term to the traditional linear regression model, which encourages sparse solutions where some coefficients are forced to be exactly zero2. This feature makes LASSO particularly useful for feature selection, as it can automatically identify and discard irrelevant or redundant variables2.\n",
    "Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques in the following ways:\n",
    "•\tRidge Regression: Both Lasso and Ridge regression are regularization methods that attempt to minimize the sum of squared residuals (RSS) along with some penalty term. The main difference between Ridge and Lasso regression is the way they shrink the coefficients. Ridge regression can reduce all the coefficients by a small amount but Lasso can reduce some features more than others and hence can completely eliminate those features3.\n",
    "•\tLinear Regression: In contrast to Linear Regression, Lasso Regression introduces an additional penalty term based on the absolute values of the coefficients. The L1 regularization term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter λ2. This penalty term encourages simple, sparse models (i.e., models with fewer parameters). This particular type of regression is well-suited for models showing high levels of multicollinearity or when you want to automate certain parts of model selection, like variable selection/parameter elimination2.\n",
    "In summary, Lasso Regression is a powerful tool in the field of machine learning and statistics, providing a balance between model simplicity and accuracy, and offering the advantage of feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to handle high-dimensional data with a small number of observations1. Lasso Regression offers a powerful framework for both prediction and feature selection, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where the number of features is large2.\n",
    "Lasso Regression has the ability to set the coefficients for features it does not consider interesting to zero3. This means that the model does some automatic feature selection to decide which features should and should not be included on its own3. This results in a sparse model that only includes the most relevant features, making it easier to interpret and more computationally efficient1.\n",
    "Another advantage of Lasso Regression is that it involves a penalty factor that determines how many features are retained; using cross-validation to choose the penalty factor helps assure that the model will generalize well to future data samples4. By striking a balance between simplicity and accuracy, Lasso can provide interpretable models while effectively managing the risk of overfitting2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean.\n",
    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model are interpreted in the same way as those of a standard linear regression model. They represent the change in the dependent variable for each one-unit change in an independent variable, assuming all other variables remain constant.\n",
    "However, Lasso Regression has a unique property: it tends to shrink the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero. This means that features with a coefficient of zero after the Lasso Regression has been run have been effectively removed from the model. This feature selection process can help with model interpretability and in dealing with high dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "n Lasso Regression, the tuning parameters that can be adjusted are:\n",
    "1.\tAlpha: This is the constant that multiplies the L1 term, controlling regularization strength. Alpha must be a non-negative float i.e. in [0, inf). When alpha = 0, the objective is equivalent to ordinary least squares, solved by the LinearRegression object1.\n",
    "2.\tFit Intercept: This is a boolean parameter that decides whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations (i.e. data is expected to be centered)1.\n",
    "3.\tMax Iterations: This is the maximum number of iterations1.\n",
    "4.\tTolerance: This is the tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are smaller than tol, the optimization code checks the dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller than tol1.\n",
    "5.\tWarm Start: When set to True, it reuses the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution1.\n",
    "6.\tPositive: When set to True, forces the coefficients to be positive1.\n",
    "7.\tRandom State: The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random feature to update1.\n",
    "8.\tSelection: If set to ‘random’, a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default\n",
    "In machine learning, a model’s performance can be significantly affected by the parameters that are adjusted during the training process. These parameters, often referred to as hyperparameters, control aspects of the training process or the model itself, and their settings can influence the learning behavior of the model and thus the quality of the learned parameters.\n",
    "Here are some ways in which adjusting parameters can affect a model’s performance:\n",
    "1.\tLearning Rate: This is one of the most important hyperparameters. If it’s too high, the model might overshoot the optimal solution. If it’s too low, the model might need too many iterations to converge to the best values. So, finding a good value is crucial.\n",
    "2.\tRegularization Parameters: Regularization helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. A high regularization parameter will make the model simpler (may underfit), while a low one may make the model complex and cause overfitting.\n",
    "3.\tNumber of Iterations: The number of epochs or iterations can also affect the model. Too few may mean the model is under-optimized, while too many may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "4.\tBatch Size: The size of the batch used in batch gradient descent affects the speed and stability of the learning process. A smaller batch size usually means that learning is less stable, more noisy, but could possibly converge faster. A larger batch size usually means that learning is more stable, less noisy, but the learning process can be slower.\n",
    "5.\tNumber of Hidden Layers/Units: In neural networks, the number of hidden layers and units in each layer can affect the model’s capacity. More layers or units increase the model’s complexity and can help it learn more complex patterns, but they also increase the risk of overfitting and the computational cost.\n",
    "6.\tInitialization: The way the model’s parameters are initialized can affect the starting point of the optimization process and, in some cases, the final outcome of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                                                                                                              \n",

    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                                                                                                              \n",

However, it’s important to note that Lasso Regression itself is a linear model and can only fit linear relationships between features and target variables directly.\n",
    "For non-linear regression problems, we can use Lasso Regression with some modifications. One common approach is to use polynomial features or other non-linear transformations of the input features. This allows the linear model to fit a non-linear function to the data.\n",
    "Lasso Regression is primarily a linear method, but it can be extended to non-linear regression problems with some modifications1. Here’s how:\n",
    "1.\tTransformations: You can create non-linear terms through transformations (e.g., squaring or taking the log of a predictor variable) and include these transformed variables in the Lasso model2.\n",
    "2.\tNon-linear Models: The essential part of LASSO is adding an L1 norm of the coefficients to the main term, f(x, y, β) + λ||β||1. There’s no reason f has to be a linear model1. It may not have an analytic solution or be convex, but there’s nothing stopping you from trying it out, and it should still induce sparsity, contingent on a large enough lambda1.\n",
    "3.\tMachine Learning Models: Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow support L1-norm regularization, which is a big theme in optimization1. This allows Lasso-like regularization to be applied in non-linear settings.\n",
    "4.\tSpecific Packages: Certain packages like spikeSlabGAM can build non-linear models and perform selection2.\n",
    "Remember, if your model is non-linear because of one parameter, there are things which can be done. If you can linearize the model, then yes, but for an approximate solution in the least squares sense1.\n",

However, in Lasso Regression, some coefficients can become exactly zero, effectively excluding the corresponding feature from the model42. Ridge Regression, on the other hand, can only shrink the coefficients close to zero but not exactly zero2.\n",

This type of regularization can result in sparse models with few coefficients; Some coefficients can become zero and eliminated from the model. Larger penalties result in coefficient values closer to zero, which is the ideal for producing simpler models.\n",
    "2.\tFeature Selection: Unlike Ridge regression, which never fully eliminates variables from the equation, Lasso does both parameter shrinkage and variable selection automatically because it forces the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients to be less than a fixed value, which forces certain coefficients to be set to zero, effectively choosing a simpler model that does not include those coefficients. This property is a result of the nature of the L1 norm, which tends to produce solutions where many parameters are zero.\n",
